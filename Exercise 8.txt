Que.1)In the Person.Person table, how many people are associated with each PersonType? 
--> SELECT PersonType, COUNT(PersonType)
	FROM Person.Person
	GROUP BY PersonType;
	
Que.2)Using only one query, find out how many products in Production.Product are the color “red” and how many are “black”
-->SELECT Color , COUNT(Color)
	FROM Production.Product
	WHERE Color IN ('Red','Black')
	GROUP BY Color;

Que.3)Using Sales.SalesOrderHeader, how many sales occurred in each territory between July 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006?  Order the results by the sale count in descending order.
--> SELECT 
		TerritoryID ,
		COUNT(*) AS SalesCount 
	FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
	WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '7/1/2005' AND '12/31/2006'
	GROUP BY TerritoryID

Que.4)Expanding on the previous example, group the results not by the TerritoryID but by the name of the territory (found in the Sales.SalesTerritory table). 
--> SELECT 
		ST.Name AS TerritoryName,
		COUNT(*) AS SalesCount 
	FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader SOH
	LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.SalesTerritory ST
	ON ST.TerritoryID = SOH.TerritoryID
	WHERE SOH.OrderDate BETWEEN '7/1/2005' AND '12/31/2006'
	GROUP BY ST.Name;
